This is a silly little rabit-hole project which was initially a bash script that I ran via
cron. At some point I decided I wanted to run it as a launchagent because cron jobs won't
"catch up" if the machine was in sleep mode at the scheduled time. With launchagent and recent
osx versions, the app needs "full disk access" for some reason. Except the app is this case is
bash, and not my script itself. That started to feel like I was opening my machine to all sorts
of abuse.
Remembering how easy it is to run shell commands in Kotlin, I figured I'd give kotlin native a go.
